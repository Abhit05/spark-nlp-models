# Spark NLP Models Hub

üåè English 

A very basic models hub for managing and updating Spark NLP models and pipelines. The aim of this hub is to help the community share and reuse Spark NLP pretrained models. The hub supports models description, tagging and searching. We offer 2 ways for publishing a new model on the model hub:
1) Directly by adding a new model description file on our git repo under https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp-models/tree/models_hub/modelshub/_posts 
2) By filling in a simple model description from available here: models.johnsnowlabs.com

The models will be stored on a public s3 bucket, from where they can be freely downloaded and used via the Spark NLP library.
