### BioBERT models pack:

We are very excited to share these 5 new BioBERT models with our enterprise users!

| Model                                  |   name     |   language     |   loc     |
|----------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
|BertEmbeddingsModel | `biobert_pubmed_cased`|en|clinical/models|
|BertEmbeddingsModel | `biobert_pmc_cased`|en|clinical/models|
|BertEmbeddingsModel | `biobert_pubmed_pmc_cased`|en|clinical/models|
|BertEmbeddingsModel | `biobert_clinical_cased`|en|clinical/models|
|BertEmbeddingsModel | `biobert_discharge_cased`|en|clinical/models|
    
The first 3 models `biobert_pubmed_cased`, `biobert_pmc_cased`, and `biobert_pubmed_pmc_cased` are thanks to [BioBERT](https://github.com/naver/biobert-pretrained) pretrained models from their paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.08746
And the last two models `biobert_clinical_cased` and `biobert_discharge_cased` are from another amazing release called [clinicalBERT](https://github.com/EmilyAlsentzer/clinicalBERT) from their paper: https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W19-1909/
